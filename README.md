# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the first app that I made by myself in Swift. It is built in the new SwiftUI framework. It is a basic 2 player tic tac toe app. I wanted to make this app to see the difficult difference between Java and Swift. What I learned was that Swift is a lot easier to pick up than Java.
